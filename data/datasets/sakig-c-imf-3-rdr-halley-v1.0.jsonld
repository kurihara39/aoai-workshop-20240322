    "description": "The original Data Set Name was MST5IMF. The data was delivered personally by Oyama. The component values indicate a crossing of the neutral sheet. The magnetic field is defined in terms of solar ecliptic coordinates with spacecraft at the center and the x direction positive towards the Sun, the y direction in the ecliptic plane, and the z direction given by a left handed coordinate system. A total force value is also given.",
