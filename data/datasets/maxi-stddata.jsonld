    "description":"MAXI (Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image) is mounted on the Japanese Experimental Module (KIBO) of the International Space Station. MAXI has been developed in collaboration of JAXA and RIKEN. MAXI has not only a wide field of view, but also a higher sensitivity than previous all-sky monitors by an order of magnitude. The observation has started in August 2009. More detailed information on MAXI can be found in the MAXI homepage at RIKEN, which produces and archives high-level data products such as images and light-curves for public release. MAXI carries two types of instruments, Gas Slit Camera (GSC) and Solid-state Slit Camera (SSC). The GSC is composed of 12 one-dimensional PSPCs (counter ID = 0-9, A, B), and covers the 2 -- 30 keV energy range with an energy resolution of 18 % (5.9 keV). The SSC is composed of two cameras, SSC-H and SSC-Z, each has 16 chips of X-ray CCDs, and covers the 0.5 -- 12 keV energy range with an energy resolution of < 150 eV (5.9 keV).",
